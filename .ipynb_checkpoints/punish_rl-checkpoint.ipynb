In RL problems, the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) — a model in which at any state, an agent can choose from some set of actions that will influence the probabilities of transitioning to different states, and the set of possible actions and transition probabilities from any given state are fixed. In other words, the actions and transition probabilities are a state function rather than a path function.\n",

The most clear example is that if you play a Punish against a Dodge and the enemy does not follow up with a Punish, you know that they do not have a Punish in hand. Additionally, if both players feint and do not use Punish until the last measure, you know with certainty the single card that is in the enemy's hand.\n",

In actuality, we expect a human player to (on average) avoid taking actions that will lead to imminent defeat. However, human players lack the computational power to estimate expected rewards by considering anything deeper than the immediate Breath. Additionally, attitudes toward risk-taking will also inform a human player's behavior. This is beyond the scope of what we are able to derive from a strictly logical premise. So, we turn to data."

In this method, we will use the empirical distribution of actions taken from a given state by real players as the \"evidence\" term in Bayes' rule to reweight the parameters of a multinomial probability distribution, which we use to represent the mixed strategy. We will use a Dirichlet prior with equal probabilities, as it is the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution."
